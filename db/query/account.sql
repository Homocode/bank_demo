FOR NO KEY UPDATE
-- FOR UPDATE is used in a Tx (let's call it Tx1) to lock the table for other Tx's, thus, no other queries 
-- coming from another Tx (let's call it Tx2) can be executed on the table, so if Tx2 attemps to operate 
-- on the lock table, Tx2 gets block until Tx1 (that performs the lock) is finished (COMMITED or ROLLBACK).
-- Only then Tx2 is able to operate on accounts table and the Tx is "unblock".
--
-- NO KEY tell postgres that the primary key isnt going to be update.
-- If NO KEY isnt use a "DEADLOCK" will occur because other tables use the accounts table
-- primary key (id) as their foregein keys.
-- When the table accounts get lock (because of the use of FOR UPDATE) from Tx1, Tx2 canÂ´t operate 
-- (read/write) from the accounts table row that is lock, so when Tx2 need to access the account row to
-- get the account id to use it as a foregin key for a new record on another table (transfers or entries)
-- it can't access it due to the lock that is being held on accounts table row from Tx1. So Tx2 also get
-- block and that is why the deadlock occurs (a deadlock is a situation in which two or more transactions 
-- are waiting for one another to give up locks.)
